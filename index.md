# tutuf is a 

small company founded in 2007 that builds and maintains complex web apps. Our biggest projects are a [manufacturing planning system](https://github.com/tutuf/sht/) (2006-2014) and an [online shop with mutiple sales channels](https://laptop.bg) (2009-present). 

We are agile with a small 'a'. We work in small iterations, looping frequently between understanding client requirements, coding, testing and deploying. We review our code and automatically test it.

We build with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We have worked with message queues and event logs ([Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)). We know how to scale apps and integrate APIs. We maintain several open source [Ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).
