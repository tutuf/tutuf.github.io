# Who we are

tutuf is a small company founded in 2007 that has built and maintained several complex web apps. 
We are agile with a small 'a' - we work in small iterations that include frequent loops
of refining client requirements, coding, testing and deploying. Our skill we value most is
open and honest communication with everybody involved in the projects we undertake.

We put emphasis on code quality with regular code reviews and an extensive automated test suite (end-to-end tests included). While we are full-stack developers focused on backend, we collaborate with front-end developers, UX designers,
quality assurance and devops engineers.

Our development stack is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We utilize a lot of the PostgreSQL advanced features (e.g. materialized views, complex SQL queries) to build robust and performant relational databases. We have experience with message queues and event logs, as well as application scaling and integration with third party API providers. We maintain several open source [ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).

All of us have degrees from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://fmi.uni-sofia.bg/) at the [Saint Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia](https://uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).
