# environmemtal policy

We try to minimize our footprint by  using our hardware as long as possible. Climate change is real, and infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet.

# moral policy

We don’t work with companies in gambling, tobacco, weapons, or those engaging in exploitative practices and/or harmfully addictive products.
