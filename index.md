# Who we are

tutuf is a small company founded in 2007 that builds and maintains complex web app. Our biggest projects are a [manufacturing planning system](https://github.com/tutuf/sht/) (2006-2014) and [online shop with mutiple sales channels](https://laptop.bg) (2009-present). 

We are agile with a small 'a' - we work in small iterations that include frequent loops of refining client requirements, coding, testing and deploying. We highly value open and honest communication with everybody involved in the projects we undertake.

We put emphasis on code quality with regular code reviews and extensive automated test suite (end-to-end tests included). While we are full-stack developers focused on backend, we collaborate with UX designers, front-end developers, quality assurance and devops engineers.

Our development stack is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We use PostgreSQL's advanced features to build robust and performant databases. We have experience with message queues and event logs (like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)), as well as application scaling and integration with third party API providers. We maintain several open source [ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).
