# Who we are

tutuf is a small company founded in 2007 that builds and maintains complex web app. Our biggest projects are a [manufacturing planning system](https://github.com/tutuf/sht/) (2006-2014) and [online shop with mutiple sales channels](https://laptop.bg) (2009-present). 

We are agile with a small 'a' - we work in small iterations that include frequent loops of understanding client requirements, coding, testing and deploying. We strive to communicate in an open and honest manner.

We put emphasis on quality with code reviews and automated tests. We focus primarily on backend and we collaborate with UX designers, front-end developers, quality assurance and devops engineers.

Our development stack is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We have worked with message queues and event logs (like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)). We know how to scale apps and integratate with third party API providers. We maintain several open source [ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).
