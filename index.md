# Who we are

tutuf is a small company founded in 2007 that builds and maintains complex web app. Our biggest projects are a [manufacturing planning system](https://github.com/tutuf/sht/) (2006-2014) and [online shop with mutiple sales channels](https://laptop.bg) (2009-present). 

We are agile with a small 'a' - we work in small iterations that include frequent loops of understanding client requirements, coding, testing and deploying. We ask a lot of question to discern client's needs. 

To assure quality we review our code and test it with automated suite. We focus on backend and collaborate with UX designers, front-end developers, quality assurance and devops engineers.

Our development stack is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We have worked with message queues and event logs (like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)). We know how to scale apps and integratate with third party API providers. We maintain several open source [ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).
