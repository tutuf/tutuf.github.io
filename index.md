# Need help with your project?

Our combined experience with Ruby on Rails is half a century. We can help at any stage of a project: proof of concept, building a minimum viable product, upgrading Rails and gems, optimizing database queries and schema, setting multistaged deployment, scaling, and maintaining legacy code. Contact us at [help@tutuf.com](mailto:help@tutuf.com). 

# Moral policy

We don’t work with gambling, tobacco, and weapons companies as well as those engaging in exploitative practices, harmful addiction, or environmentally damaging activities.

# Environmental policy

We try to minimize our footprint by  using our hardware as long as we can. Climate change is real, and infinite growth on a finite planet is impossible.
