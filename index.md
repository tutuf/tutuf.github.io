# tutuf is a 

small company founded in 2007 that builds and maintains web applications. Our biggest projects are a [manufacturing planning system](https://github.com/tutuf/sht/) (2006-2014) and [Bulgaria’s #10 online shop](https://laptop.bg) (2009-present). 

We work in small iterations, looping frequently between understanding client requirements, coding and deploying. We review our code and cover it with automated tests.

We build with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/). We maintain several open source [Ruby gems](https://github.com/tutuf/).
