# How do we do it

## With clients
1. We listen to you to understand what you need.
1. We estimate roughly the time required to make the software.
1. We split the work in small iterations during which we implement the negotiated functionality.
1. We deploy regularly on a staging server so that you can see and try what we've done. If you have any remarks, we recover them and deploy again until you're almost completely satisfied.
1. We deploy in production environment.
1. Profit!!
