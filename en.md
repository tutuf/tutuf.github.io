# How do we do it

## With clients
1. We listen to you to understand what you need.
1. We estimate roughly the time required to create a solution to your problem.
1. We split the work in small iterations during which we implement the negotiated functionality.
1. We deploy regularly on a staging server so that you can see and try what we have done. If you have any remarks, we address them and redeploy.
1. We deploy to production (that is, servers your customers hit).
1. Profit!!
